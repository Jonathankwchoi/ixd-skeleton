			"lyrics": "Risin' up, back on the street\r\nDid my time, took my chances\r\nWent the distance, now I'm back on my feet\r\nJust a man and his will to survive\r\nSo many times, it happens too fast\r\nYou trade your passion for glory\r\nDon't lose your grip on the dreams of the past\r\nYou must fight just to keep them alive\r\nIt's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight\r\nRisin' up to the challenge of our rival\r\nAnd the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night\r\nAnd he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger\r\nFace to face, out in the heat\r\nHangin' tough, stayin' hungry\r\nThey stack the odds 'til we take to the street\r\nFor the kill with the skill to survive\r\nIt's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight\r\nRisin' up to the challenge of our rival\r\nAnd the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night\r\nAnd he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger\r\nRisin' up, straight to the top\r\nHad the guts, got the glory\r\nWent the distance, now I'm not gonna stop\r\nJust a man and his will to survive\r\nIt's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight\r\nRisin' up to the challenge of our rival\r\nAnd the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night\r\nAnd he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger\r\nThe eye of the tiger\r\nThe eye of the tiger\r\nThe eye of the tiger\r\nThe eye of the tiger"

			"lyrics": "Once upon a time not so long ago\r\nTommy used to work on the docks\r\nUnion's been on strike\r\nHe's down on his luck\r\nIt's tough, so tough\r\nGina works the diner all day\r\nWorking for her man\r\nShe brings home her pay\r\nFor love, for love\r\nShe says, \"We've gotta hold on to what we've got\r\nIt doesn't make a difference if we make it or not\r\nWe've got each other and that's a lot\r\nFor love we'll give it a shot.\"\r\nWhoa, we're half-way there\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nTake my hand, we'll make it. I swear\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nTommy's got his six string in hock\r\nNow he's holding in\r\nWhat he used to make it talk\r\nSo tough, it's tough\r\nGina dreams of running away\r\nWhen she cries in the night\r\nTommy whispers\r\n\"Baby, it's okay, someday\r\nWe've gotta hold on to what we've got\r\nIt doesn't make a difference if we make it or not\r\nWe've got each other and that's a lot\r\nFor love we'll give it a shot\r\nWhoa, we're half-way there\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nTake my hand and we'll make it. I swear\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nLivin' on a prayer\r\nWe've gotta hold on ready or not\r\nYou live for the fight when it's all that you've got\r\nWhoa, we're half-way there\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nTake my hand and we'll make it, I swear\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nWhoa, we're half-way there\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer\r\nTake my hand and we'll make it, I swear\r\nWhoa, livin' on a prayer"
